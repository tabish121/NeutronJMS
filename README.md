NeutronJMS
=======

The NeutronJMS project brings together ideas from various other JMS based clients that implement a specific underlying protocol such as STOMP, AMQP, OpenWire etc.  The idea is to provide a standard and robust JMS framework along with a well defined plugin model for supporting any wire level protocol that can have JMS mapped onto it.  

Besides the JMS layer the project will provide a common set of features to all the wire level providers such as failover support and dynamic broker discovery.
